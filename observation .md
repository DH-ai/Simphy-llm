**
Query Interpretation:**


The user wants to add two disc objects to a SimPhy simulation and connect them using
 a spring joint. They likely expect code snippets or instructions on how to achieve this
.

**Context Assessment:**

The retrieved RAG results provide some relevant information, but lack a concise, step-by-step guide.

*   **
Rag Result 0:** Shows how to add a rectangle and connect it to a disc with a spring. This is partially relevant but needs adaptation for two discs.
*
   **Rag Result 1:** Mentions setting actions on bodies, which is not directly relevant to the core task of adding and connecting discs with a spring.
*   **Rag Result 2:** Lists `addDisc` and `
addDistanceJoint` methods, which are useful, but the user wants a spring joint, not a distance joint. It also shows `setBounds` and `setGravity` which are not relevant.
*   **Rag Result 3:**
 Discusses collision events, which is irrelevant to the user's query.
*   **Rag Result 4:** Describes adding discs on a timer, which is not relevant.
*   **Rag Result 5:** Shows how to manipulate existing discs, not create new ones and connect them.
*   **Rag
 Result 6:** Lists `addPolygon`, `addRectangle`, `addRevoluteJoint`, `addSpringJoint`, `addTracer`, `clear`, `createCopy`, `createGroup`, `getBody`, `getBodyAt`, `getCameraBody`, `getController` methods.

**Analysis of Gaps:**


1.  **Missing Direct Example:** There isn't a single, complete example showing how to add *two* discs and connect them with a spring joint. The closest is Rag Result 0, but it involves a rectangle.
2.  **Lack of Specificity:** The documentation doesn't explicitly state
 the units for the spring constant in `addSpringJoint`. [Uncertain: Need to verify if units are documented elsewhere].
3.  **Implicit Knowledge:** The user is assumed to know how to access the `World` object and where to place the code (e.g., in a script or event handler).
4
.  **Hallucination Risk:** The documentation mentions `addDistanceJoint` which is not what the user asked for.

**Scope for Improvement:**

1.  **Prompt Improvement:** The prompt is clear, but could be more specific about the desired spring behavior (e.g., "add two discs and connect
 them with a spring with a specific stiffness and damping").
2.  **RAG Chunk Improvement:**
    *   Create a dedicated documentation section with examples of creating and connecting various bodies using different joint types, including spring joints between two discs.
    *   Include code snippets that are easily copyable and runnable.

    *   Explicitly state the units for spring constant and damping in the `addSpringJoint` documentation.
3.  **Documentation Coverage:**
    *   Add a section explaining how to access the `World` object and where to place simulation code (e.g., in the `onStart` or `onUpdate
` script).
    *   Provide more context on the parameters of the `addSpringJoint` function (e.g., what the `null, null` arguments represent in Rag Result 0). [Speculative: Assuming these are anchor points, clarify their purpose].
