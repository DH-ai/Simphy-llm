Accessing Body /Joint in Script
Body or joint already existing in simulation can be accessed by calling getBody() and getJoint() functions of \'world\' object.
For example:
var d=World.getBody("Disc"); //stores body of name \'Disc\' in variable d var jt=World.getJoint("joint1");
//stores joint of name \'joint1\' in variable jtFor example:
var d=World.getBody("Disc"); //stores body of name \'Disc\' in variable d var jt=World.getJoint("joint1");
//stores joint of name \'joint1\' in variable jt//stores joint of name \'joint1\' in variable jtCreating Body / Joints
1. By Defining New Objects
New Body or joint can be created by calling world.addXXX() and world.addXXXJoint() functions.
The following code creates a rectangle and a disc connected by a spring of force constant 40 N/m. var d = World.addDisc(0.5); var r = World.addRectangle(1, 1); r.setPosition(2, 0); var j = World.addSpringJoint(d, r, null, null, 30, 0);
2. From Existing Objects
Clone of body can be created and added to world by calling function createCopy(body) in world object.
var d=World.getBody("Disc"); var d1=World.createCopy(d); //creates copy of Disc and adds to world
Clones of body can also be created by calling copy() from body object, but note that this function creates copy of object and returns it without adding it to world.
This returned copy can later be added to world by using world.addBody(); var d=World.getBody("Disc"); var d1=d.copy(); World.addBody(d1);1. By Defining New Objects

There exist few functions in body object to change body\'s color, image and text.
var d=World.getBody("Disc"); d.setFillColor(“white”); d.setOutlineColor(new Color("red"))
d.setBrush("image1"); //make sure animation with name "image1" already exists d.setText("custom text");
var j=World.getJoint("joint");
Hello [font="default-large", color="red"alignX="left"alignY="top"x="-1",y="0.2"] Mr Anderson [color="blue"x="0.03"y="0.1"] How r u?
j.setColor(new Color("green"));var d=World.getBody("Disc"); d.setFillColor(“white”); d.setOutlineColor(new Color("red"))
d.setBrush("image1"); //make sure animation with name "image1" already exists d.setText("custom text");
var j=World.getJoint("joint");
Hello [font="default-large", color="red"alignX="left"alignY="top"x="-1",y="0.2"] Mr Anderson [color="blue"x="0.03"y="0.1"] How r u?
j.setColor(new Color("green"));Setting Text on Body
Body can act like a text display box by setting its text property using setText(text) method on body object text can be simple text or may contain shortcodes for multiple styles defined by comma separated attribute value pairs inside square brackets.
● Allowed attributes
font = Name of currently loaded fonts x
=
x coordinate of text position in body local coordinates
y
=
y coordinate of text position in body local coordinates color = CSS color string like "red" or "rgb(255,0,0)" etc xalign = 0, 1 or 2 for left, center and right respectively yalign = 0, 1 or 2 for bottom, up and down respectively
For example,
Following value of text set on rectangular body will result as in screenshot below.● Allowed attributes

All kinematic properties like position, velocity, rotation as well as dynamic properties like mass, inertia, force and torque can be accessed and set using script.
for example the following code instantly brings body to origin and set is speed 3m/s in y direction (by applying suitable impulse) var d = World.getBody("Disc"); d.setPosition(0, 0); d.setVelocity(0, 0); d.applyImpulse(new Vector2(0, 3).product(d.getMass()));Actions
Each body has an action which is updated each frame internally.
Many types of actions are included with SimPhy.
These can be instantiated, configured, and added to a body.
When the action is complete, it will automatically be removed from it.
Actions are generally used to perform some task, often over time, giving nice effect using specific interpolation.
Actions are created using methods of actions object, for example following code moves body from position (0,0) to (3,0) in 3 seconds following "bounce" interpolation.
var d = World.getBody("Disc"); //don\'t let other forces interact with body d.setMass(0);
//set initial position of body d.setPosition(0, 0);
//create action object var a = Actions.moveTo(3, 0, 4, "bounce"); //set action to body d.setAction(a);
Try adding the above code in some button click event run simulation, then click the button to see bouncy animation of Disc (assuming it exists in simulation !
