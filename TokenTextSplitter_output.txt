Query: how to creaate a disc

Content: 
Represent this passage for retrieval: Body("Disc"); d.setPosition(0, 0); d.setVelocity(0, 0); d.applyImpulse(new Vector2(0, 3).product(d.getMass()));
Actions
Each body has an action which is updated each frame internally.
Many types of actions are included with SimPhy.
These can be instantiated, configured, and added to a body.
When the action is complete, it will automatically be removed from it.
Actions are generally used to perform some task, often over time, giving nice effect using specific interpolation.
Actions are created using methods of actions object, for example following code moves body from position (0,0) to (3,0) in 3 seconds following "bounce" interpolation.
var d = World.getBody("Disc");
//don\'t let other forces interact with body d.setMass(0);
//set initial position of body d.setPosition(0, 0);
//create action object var a = Actions.moveTo(3, 0, 4, "bounce");
//set action to body d.setAction(a);
Try adding the above code in some button click event run simulation, then click the button to see bouncy animation of Disc (assuming it exists in simulation !
