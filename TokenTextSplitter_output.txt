Content: 
Represent this passage for retrieval: For example:
Say that you want to add discs to the simulation after every 100 steps Step 1: Declare global variable t in script t=0; to onStart Script in world Step 2: Create disc after every 100 steps var t = 0; function world_onUpdate(time, dt) {t++; if (t == 100) {World.addDisc(0.2); t = 0;}}
The "OnUpdate" property can also be useful to put constraint over object\'s motion.
